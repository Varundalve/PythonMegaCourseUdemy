# Flask and PostgreSql
This is a project to understand and practise Python Flask and PostgreSql.

# What we do
* We create an app in Flask (height collector), where we render a webpage and ask user to input email and height.
* Once the user inputs these information and submits, user is redirected to success page.
* Also the value input by user is stored in PostgreSql.
* We make some calculation like total users in DB and AVG height of all users.
* Finally we send a mail to users with their height and the average height from the group of users.
